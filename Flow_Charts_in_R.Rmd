## Introduction

In the field of data analytics, data visualization is the name of the game. I have recently noticed how much I love R over Python for my data visualization needs. Because of this, I have started a small blog series on R visualizations beginning with this blog on flow charts. you can find the blog on my [medium](https://medium.com/@paulaleksis/r-visualizations-flow-charts-in-r-4cfa7f783872).

```{r}
# install.packages("DiagrammeR") # used to install the package dependencies needed for this blog
library(DiagrammeR)
```

Once the library has loaded, we will use the `grViz()` function to setup the bones of our flow chart.

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']
  
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3;
}
  
  [1]: 'Learning Data Science'
  [2]: 'Industry vs Technical Knowledge'    
  [3]: 'Statistics vs Mathematics Knowledge'    
  ")
```

Within the syntax, 


## Adding Color
It is also possible to add color to the outline of your nodes, or even fill them with a color. To do so, add additional arguments "color" and "style" to the node section of the syntax as shown below.

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = oval, color = grey, style = filled]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']
  
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3;
}
  
  [1]: 'Learning Data Science'
  [2]: 'Industry vs Technical Knowledge'    
  [3]: 'Statistics vs Mathematics Knowledge'    
  ")

```

## Splitting Connection to Multiple Nodes

You are able to split the connection to multiple nodes. To do so just change how your structure your tab argument.

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
      # define node aesthetics
      node [fontname = Arial, shape = oval, color = Lavender, style = filled]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']

      # set up node layout
      tab1 -> tab2;
      tab2 -> tab3;
      tab2 -> tab4
      }

      [1]: 'Learning Data Science'
      [2]: 'Industry vs Technical Knowledge'
      [3]: 'Python/R'
      [4]: 'Domain Experience'
      ")
```


## More Customizability

There are some additional arguments you can include in your function to customize things such as font size, font color, height, width, alpha, etcâ€¦ For more customizability options refer to the [documentation](https://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/graphviz_and_mermaid.html) Once you have selected the styles or additions you want, add them as arguments within the `node[]` portion of your function.

```{r}
grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
      # define node aesthetics
      node [fontname = Arial, shape = oval, color = DeepSkyBlue, style = filled, fontcolor = White]        
      tab1 [label = '@@1']
      tab2 [label = '@@2']
      tab3 [label = '@@3']
      tab4 [label = '@@4']

      # set up node layout
      tab1 -> tab2;
      tab2 -> tab3;
      tab2 -> tab4
      }

      [1]: 'Learning Data Science'
      [2]: 'Industry vs Technical Knowledge'
      [3]: 'Python/R'
      [4]: 'Domain Experience'
      ")
```



## Conclusion

Flow charts are a great way to express ideas especially at the beginning stages of production. Consider using R visualizations in your future work and take advantage of its powerful libraries.
